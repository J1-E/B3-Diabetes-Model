System to model diabetes patient and test controller's ability to maintain blood glucose homeostasis 

Project 3 - Insulin Pump That Delivers Glycogen and Insulin
Insulin lowers blood glucose my promoting uptake of storage. Glucagon raises blood glucose by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. A healthy pancreas continuously balances both hormones to maintain glucose homeostasis. Currently, insulin pumps only deliver insulin, meaning patients have to manually raise their blood sugar levels by eating sugary snacks. This system would reduce how often they must do that by delivering glucagon to the patient when bloody glucose levels fall too low. The system would make use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) which are already widely available to measure interstitial glucose and sends the data wirelessly to the control algorithm. Key measurements would be glucose concentration, rate of change of glucose, insulin on board and glucagon on board. Meal and Activity data could also be inputted. The pump would have two reservoirs, one for insulin and one for glucagon. The delivery of both hormones is automatically adjusted based on algorithmic commands. The control algorithm processes the data from the CGM and computes the optimal dosing. The system would have safety constraints on maximum/minimum hormone delivery and could suspend insulin if glucose levels were falling too rapidly
